# Introduction 
TestMopups is for testing the Mopups (https://github.com/LuckyDucko/Mopups) package in isolation for our main app.

# Getting Started
TestMopups is a MAUI app that targets Android, iOS and Windows. It can be downloaded and run in Debug mode with no changes (or perhaps minor changes).

Also included are project settings to use an AdHoc provisioning profile from iOS to allow a Release build to be deployed from VS2022 directly to a specific iPad. You must provide your own provisioning profile if you wish to use that type of build/deployment.

An Azure Pipeline file is included that is setup for pipeline processes. That will need to be modified for any other environment.
